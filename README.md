# React-Leaflet-Map-App

This is a React application that utilizes the React Leaflet library to display an interactive map with markers. The app integrates with the Mapbox API to provide tile layers and enables users to explore and interact with the map interface. It serves as a foundation for creating customized map-based applications and can be easily extended with additional functionality.

## Project Structure

The structure of the app is as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `components/` - Holds reusable React components used in the app.
  - `App.js` - The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - `Map.js` - Component responsible for rendering the interactive map.
  - `Marker.js` - Component for displaying markers on the map.
- `public/` - Contains static assets and the HTML file for the app.
- `package.json` - Configuration file that lists the dependencies and defines various scripts for running and building the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. It starts a development server and opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This command runs the tests and monitors the source files for changes. It provides a convenient way to continuously test the app during development. Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. It creates a optimized and minified bundle of the app in the `build` folder. This bundle is ready to be deployed to a web server. The generated filenames include unique hashes for cache busting. More information about deployment can be found in the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This operation is irreversible!**

This command should be used with caution. It allows you to eject from the default configuration and have full control over the build tools and configuration files. Once ejected, you cannot go back to the default setup. It copies all the configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, allowing you to modify them to fit your requirements. However, it also means you are responsible for maintaining and configuring these tools yourself. It is recommended to use this command only if you have a good understanding of the underlying build setup.

Feel free to explore and customize the app according to your needs. Happy coding!
